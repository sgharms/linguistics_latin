# Linguistics::Latin

A module which models the Latin language's verbs an phonographic
behavior.  These are behaviors and inhabitants of Latin grammar
universe.  Regardless of which programs use these data, these behaviors
will always remain true.

By way of constrast, another library (say, [LatinVerb][]) might *use*
these definitions, but does not alter them.  Particular data structures
for processing or mutating data are native to client libraries.

I should hope that in future this gem and others like it be merged into
a common Linguistics Gem.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'linguistics_latin'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install linguistics_latin

## Usage

This is pretty much a library which defines some constants.
